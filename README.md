                                      sO hEY GUYS AND WELCOME TO MY ASSESSMENT TASK
                                      tHIS DOCUMENT WILL outline the process undertaken by myself
                                      to produce this website
                                      
                                      
                                      
                                      
                                      So Upon reading the notification, i suddenly realised I wanted to make something
                                      special, that would stand out and would represent me. I initially wrote tons of code for
                                      planning websites and after receiving the notification, i quickly realised
                                      that i could use these sites for my storyboards, saving a lot of time
                                      
                                      I then proceeded to think about what types of elements i could use for each subpage. I 
                                      noticed how interactive elements were being rewarded so i placed heavy load on it.
                                      For my homepage, i know i wanted a video to kinda welcome the user to the site so they know what
                                      it would be about. I then decided i would keep the line break theme constant throughtout my website
                                      as it looked cool and allowed for easy separation. I also chose some cool typography like gradients
                                      and a span within a span to create multi colored text. The contact page was just about getting everything
                                      i needed initally but then i realised i could get a little creative so i embeded a google maps to add that 
                                      interactivty. I then made a form to simulate a real portfolio however binned the js involed as it would take
                                      a lot of time and precise setup. I needed a mail link so i used the html mailto link to work this. I then used
                                      various buttons. 
                                      
                                      For the about me page i thought hard about creative ways to show the text. After research i decided that having various 
                                      images running down the left side that when hovered upon would show text overlay explaining it. This seemed great so i spent
                                      a lot of time trying to execute it and finally got it working the way i wanted to and looking somewhat acceptable. 
                                      
                                      
                                      So there was my process for the website and all the steps i took.
