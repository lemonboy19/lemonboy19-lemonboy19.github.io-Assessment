            <p>- The world wide web is a platform in which various </p>
             <p>interconnected webpages can be accessed using a web browser </p>
              <p>or similar application.</p>

              <br>
              
              
            <p>- The Web, also known as a client-server system, works by the</p>
            <p>client making a request for a particular page</p>
            <p>and then the web server should ideally relay back that page to the </p>
            <p>client and any other multimedia using HTTP.</p>
            <br>

            <p>- A web server is designed to display website content by </p>
            <p>storing, processing, or delivering webpages back to a client.</p>
            <p>Web servers implement a version of HTTP and another protocol.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>- A web browser is a software application that allows for </p>
            <p>retrieving, uploading, or browsing content on the WWW. Each</p>
            <p>web page has its own URL which allows for the browser to</p>
            <p>identify the resource and retrieve it from the web server. </p>

            <p>- The World Wide Web is the collection of information such </p>
            <p>as various webpages that can be accessed via the internet. The internet can </p>
            <p>be defined as the network that connects a very large number of computers  </p>
            <p>and similar devices globally. When comparing the two, the internet can be </p>
            <p>thought of as global network of infrastructure powering all the content </p>
            <p>and allowing for a variety of interactions between the client and the server. </p>

            <img src="intranet.jfif" class="rn" height="300" width="400">
            <p>- An intranet is a private network often found within an enterprise of sorts, </p>
            <p>that allows for the secure distribution of company information and</p>
            <p>resources between employees and staff. In a sense it’s similar to   </p>
            <p>the internet but it’s only accessible to authorized people. As mentioned before,  </p>
            <p>internet refers to the systems that connect various networks of computers  </p>
            <p>together simultaneously. The internet is public and has users globally.  </p>
            <p>Conversely, intranet is a type of network that is used privately and has a limited </p>
            <p>number of users and information. </p>

            <p>- An internet protocol is a set of rules for routing and processing various packets of data  </p>
            <p>so that they can travel across networks within the infrastructure of the Internet. </p>
            <p>As mentioned before, the data that is transported by the internet are called packets.    </p>
            <p>These rules fully dictate the delivery of data over the internet by managing flow,  </p>
            <p> access control, etc. There are various types of internet protocols, and some of these  </p>
            <p>are HTTP, TCP and FTP  </p>
